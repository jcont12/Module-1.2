          <p>GIT is a software used to track every single change that is made in your work, whatever it may be! So you dont have to deal with the usual problem of a program closing and
	     not having saved anything. It also helps to make a "new path" on your work that you can try out, if you like it then merge it to your original work or if you don't simply dismiss it!
             A Git project can be thought of as having three parts:</p>
	    <ol>
	      <li>A Working Directory: where you'll be doing all the work: creating, editing, deleting and organizing files</li>
	      <li>A Staging Area: where you'll list changes you make to the working directory</li>
	      <li>A Repository: where Git permanently stores those changes as different versions of the project</li>
	    </ol>

    <span class="code">git init -</span>(intialize) Creates a new Git repository<br />
	  <span class="code">git status -</span>  Inspects the contents of the working directory and staging area<br />
	  <span class="code">git add filename -</span> In order for Git to begin tracking changes, we must add files from the working directory to the staging area. You can use this command once with various files by adding each filename to add to staging area separated by a space. If you want to add all files, use symbol ".". <br />
	  <span class="code">git diff filename -</span> Shows the differences that have been made in a file that is being tracked (differences between the working directory and the staging area)<br />
	  <span class="code">git commit -m"" -</span> Permanently stores file changes (from the staging area in the repository).<br />
    <span class="code">git log -</span> Shows a list of all previous commits <br />
    <span class="code">git show HEAD -</span>In Git, the commit you are currently on is known as the HEAD commit. In many cases, the most recently made commit is the HEAD commit. Enter command to see the HEAD commit <br />
